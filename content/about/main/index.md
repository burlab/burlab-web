intro: |
  I develop workflows and software pipelines to process, perform QA/QC, and analyze bioanalytical data. My focus is on data automation, data-driven improvement of bioanalytical methods, reproducible data analysis and interpretation of lipidomics datasets. I help and aim to empower other scientists and students to manage, process, interrogate and interpret their bioanalytical data.
  
  I worked as a technician in a pharmaceutical bioanalytical lab, studied biology, have a minor in geography, worked as a programmer, made my PhD in plant molecular physiology, and then went (again) into bioanalytical/biomedical research.
  
  I am senior research fellow at the [Singapore Lipidomics Incubator](sling.sg) \@ National University of Singapore.
